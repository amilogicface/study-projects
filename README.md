# Repository for study

Hello there! This is my study repository. Here I try to do some new stuff with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to improve my IT skills and learn some new advanced things.

## Want to watch some of my study html/css projects?

No problem!;) I'll be really excited if you found some of them nice. Here some of them:
